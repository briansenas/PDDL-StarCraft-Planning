# PDDL-StarCraft-Planning
First approach to STRIP based language for plannification problems. 
Here we were told to design an algorithm to solve multiple tasks such as mining, building and recolecting materials.
Adding constraints and also obtaining the real minimal amount of steps necessary to achieve such tasks.

To execute you must Install `Metric-ff

The command line script to compile any of the problems is as following: 

`./Metric-ff/ff -o dominioX.pddl -f problemX.pddl -O -h 1 -g 1`
